# Obsidian Dynamic Backgrounds Plugin

This is a Dynamic Backgrounds plugin for Obsidian (<https://obsidian.md>).

This project uses TypeScript to provide type checking and documentation.
The repo depends on the latest plugin API (obsidian.d.ts) in TypeScript Definition format, which contains TSDoc comments describing what it does.

**Note:** The Obsidian API is still in early alpha and is subject to change at any time!
